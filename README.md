# [WIP] Amarok Crawler

The idea here is to crawl multiple trusted sources and gather information in one place, about cruelty-free brands, vegan products, ingridients and everything else related to compassionate ethical consumer. The result will be presented in a search-engine like interface. Maybe we will release mobile app later on.

This part of code is responsible for crawling and storing data in a database.
